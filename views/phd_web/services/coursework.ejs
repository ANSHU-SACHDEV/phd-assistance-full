  <h2>Features of Our PhD Abstract Writing Service</h2>
  <p>
    We follow university-specific or publisher-specific guidelines in the UK, US, Australia, and Asia. Abstracts can be <strong>informative</strong> (background, purpose, content overview) or <strong>descriptive</strong> (methods, results, conclusions). Based on your needs, we write abstracts that include:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Brief Introduction:</strong> Topic and context of the research.</li>
      <li><strong>Background:</strong> Overview of existing literature and rationale for study.</li>
      <li><strong>Aim or Purpose:</strong> Clearly stated objectives in 2–3 sentences.</li>
      <li><strong>Problem Statement & Literature Review:</strong> Formulation of research questions based on literature gaps.</li>
      <li><strong>Research Design:</strong> Explanation of quantitative/qualitative methods, including pilot studies if applicable.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Tools and processes used to gather data aligned with the research problem.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Interpretation of results using appropriate methods.</li>
      <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Summary of findings and implications, structured under discussion, summary, and conclusion sections.</li>
    </ul>

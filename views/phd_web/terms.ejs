<div class="main-content">
  <h2>Commitment to Researchers</h2>
  <p>
    PhD Assistance is committed to supporting researchers by guiding them through their academic journey. As researchers’ expectations vary, we offer unlimited revisions based on the initial scope agreed with our admin team (refer to our workflow process).
  </p>
</div>

<div class="main-content">
  <h2>Custom-Made Research Work</h2>
  <p>
    All our research is custom-made; we do not sell pre-written material. Clients are educated at each stage upon request (additional cost applies). Projects start within 48 hours after expert allocation. For urgent projects (less than 72 hours), work begins within 2 hours of confirmation. Refund requests must be submitted within 24 hours of project confirmation.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="main-content">
  <h2>Project Confirmation and Communication</h2>
  <p>
    Every project is assigned a unique confirmation code. All communication must include this code. Payment and additional requirements are handled by the admin team. Technical updates should be addressed to the experts’ team without altering the initial scope.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="main-content">
  <h2>Deliverables and Scope</h2>
  <p>
    Deliverables are clearly defined at project confirmation. Additional content or descriptions require opting for separate services. Requests beyond initial scope are redirected to the admin team.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="main-content">
  <h2>Payment Terms</h2>
  <p>
    - 100% advance for small tasks like assignments and proposals<br>
    - For work <30,000 words: two installments<br>
    - For work >50,000 words: three installments (40% + 30% + 30%)<br>
    Work is paused until the next payment is received. Additional requirements post-confirmation incur extra charges.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="main-content">
  <h2>Conference Calls and Support</h2>
  <p>
    Technical calls can be arranged with prior notice (Mon–Fri, 9am–6pm IST). Personal/payment matters are not discussed during these calls. Calls are followed up with a written summary for client confirmation.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="main-content">
  <h2>Revisions and Project Closure</h2>
  <p>
    Revisions are free within specified periods based on project type (e.g., 7 days for proposals, 15 days for Master’s, 30 days for PhD). Beyond this, a payment structure applies. Once a project is officially closed, new requests are billed separately.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="main-content">
  <h2>Manuscripts and Paid Content</h2>
  <p>
    We revise manuscripts for technical and formatting issues but not for basic conceptual changes. Free articles are shared when relevant; paid articles require separate purchase.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="main-content">
  <h2>Plagiarism and File Format</h2>
  <p>
    We commit to plagiarism-free content. Plagiarism reports are available at additional cost. Files are delivered in Microsoft Office 2007 or compatible formats.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="main-content">
  <h2>Workflow Process</h2>
  <p>
    Admin team handles commitments, payments, and general inquiries. Experts’ team handles only technical aspects. This separation ensures client confidentiality and clarity.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="main-content">
  <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
  <p>
    Full refund is available only if the project is not started or cancelled within 2 hours. No refund is given once work is in progress or completed. Unlimited revisions are provided instead.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="main-content">
  <h2>Referral Offer</h2>
  <p>
    Applicable only for combo services (e.g., proposal + full thesis) and full dissertation writing. Changes in initial commitment invalidate the offer. There is no limit to the number of referrals.
